    "For this analysis, my research question is \"Are any medication purchases associated with Duloxetine.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## A2. Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "As a business, an association between medication purchases would help determine resource and financial allocation to pharmaceutical products, and as a healthcare provider, an association could assist in correlating health problems and symptoms. For example, if Duloxetine, an antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication, is purchased often with Premarin, a menopause symptom relief drug, more research could be done to see if there is a correlation between those symptoms. (Duloxetine: MedlinePlus Drug Information)\n",

    "## B1. Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to better understand customer purchasing patterns (WhatIs). This is completed through the creation and filtering of Frequency (support) of Itemsets using the apriori algorithm, which will only keep the discernible association rules, and remove the noisy rules. After this, association rules are evaluated, and those related to our chosen item that score high enough are kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to get discernible association rules with Duloxetine as the antecedent or consequent. This would suggest a purchasing pattern between Duloxetine and another drug.\n",

    "Unfortunately, none of our final association rules have Duloxetine included. While Duloxetine itemsets made it through the apriori algorithm, at the time we created association rules with lift values > 1, all Duloxetine itemsets were removed. This means Duloxetine has no positive item association with any other drugs in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, the support metric was the most significant and what I believe became an immediate problem. Support is a measure of the item's frequency in the transactions. For us, this was 1.2% or around 90 records. With so few records, I do not believe it is possible to move beyond the noise and accurately see the association rules associated with Duloxetine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift was the measure of the rise in probability of having Duloxetine given the other drug, over just having Duloxetine. Using this metric to filter our rules removed Duloxetine from the analysis since in our data, Duloxetine purchases, are completely independent of the other drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, confidence is the likelihood of buying Duloxetine at the same time as the other drug. While this metric was not used to filter rules, if we did have Duloxetine rules that mirrored each other, Duloxetine as the antecedent and Duloxetine as the consequent for the same drug, the confidence value would help determine which drug was the true antecedent and consequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## D2. Practical Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "While our analysis provides no significant associations, I do think we should outline why this is the case from understanding the dataset. To begin, Duloxetine is one of many antidepressants - if it had a monopoly on this relief type, it may have been easier to see patterns. Furthermore, if all antidepressants were grouped for association rule creation, we may be able to see results from a generalized perspective. Another point to take into account is Duloxetine takes 2-4 weeks for relief, while other antidepressants usually take 1-2 weeks. Perhaps it is recommended less because it provides less value than other antidepressants. These are possible causes for the low support and should be taken into consideration while choosing the next steps.\n",

    "## D3: Recommended Action\n",
    "Since no association rules were found regarding Duloxetine, I believe no financial or medical action should be taken. However, I do believe further data gathering is required to have a dataset that not only is sufficient for the more common drugs but also the less used ones such as Duloxetine. With a larger dataset, further analysis can be done to create well-supported statements on association with Duloxetine.\n",
